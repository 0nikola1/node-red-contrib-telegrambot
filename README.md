# Telegram bot nodes for node-red

This package contains a receiver and a sender node which act as a telegram bot.
The only thing required is the token that can be retrieved by the @botfather telegram bot.
https://core.telegram.org/bots

The nodes are a simple wrapper around the  [node-telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api)

# Usage
The input node receives messages from the bot and sends a message object with the following layout:
- **payload** contains the message details
  - **chatId**  : the unique id of the chat. This value needs to be passed to the out node when responding to the same chat.
  - **type**    : the type of message received: message, photo, audio, location, video, voice, contact
  - **content** : received message content: string or file_id, or object with full data (location, contact)

- **originalMessage** contains the original message object from the underlying [node-telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api) lib.


The simple echo flow looks like:
