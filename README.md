This package contains a receiver and a sender node which act as a telegram bot.
The only thing required is the token that can be retrieved by the @botfather telegram bot.

The nodes are a simple wrapper around the  [node-telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api)

The nodes is under heavy construction right now.
